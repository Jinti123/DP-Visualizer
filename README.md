Presenting **DP-Visualizer**, the best way to learn dynamic programming. A visual tool to help understand and explore dynamic programming (DP) concepts through intuitive and interactive graphical representations.

## Features:
1) Interactive Visualizations for 5 DP algorithms: Fibonacci Sequence , Coin Change Problem , 0/1 Knapsack Problem , Longest Common Subsequence , Longest 
   Increasing Subsequence
2) Light/Dark Theme toggle
3) Play/Pause animation controls
4) Step-by-step navigation
5) Adjustable animation speed
6) DP Table visualization with real-time cell highlighting
7) Detailed explanations displayed for every computation step
8) Responsive design that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices

## How it Works? 
1) Choose a dynamic programming problem from the list.
2) Watch how subproblems are computed and reused.
3) Use controls to pause, step through, or speed up the visualization.
4) Read through the real-time explanations to deepen your understanding.

## Contribute:
It would be a great pleasure if you choose to contribute to this project. You can add more problems, improve the UI and make it more interactive. Some improvements would be to add the recursive tree visualizations or a more game-like interactive mode.
