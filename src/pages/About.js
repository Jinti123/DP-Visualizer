        <p>
          Tired of Dynamic Programming feeling like a mystery? You're not alone
          ‚Äî DP is powerful but notoriously tricky. So, I built something to
          change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Welcome to the Dynamic Programming Visualizer</strong> ‚Äî your
          interactive companion to demystify DP, one subproblem at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong> to the{" "}
          <strong>Knapsack problem</strong>, this tool doesn't just show the
          final answer ‚Äî it walks you through the journey. Watch how each cell
          in the DP table gets filled, understand the logic behind every choice,
